                <h2>What is an IOT-based weather reporting system?</h2>

                <p>
                An IOT-based weather reporting system is a system that is specifically designed to 
                facilitate the reporting of weather parameters over the internet. It involves getting 
                weather and environmental data using advanced electronic sensors and using them for 
                real-time weather monitoring and future analysis. 
                </p>
            
            <p>
                This system is an automated system that sends data via a microcontroller to the web 
                server via the internet. This data is updated live so you can check weather reports 
                directly without relying on weather forecasting agencies because at present weather 
                forecasts are not very accurate because of drastic climate changes. 
            </p>
