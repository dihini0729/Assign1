        <h2>What is IOT in Agriculturing?</h2>
        <p>The use of Internet in the agricultural world has become very common among the uses. 
            There are many factors to be considered when entering this field on agriculture, 
            such as the use of smart devices, sensors and many more.<br>
            Using IOT for image analysing is a very common method to manage issues and systems. It 
            helps to alert the growth and defects in the agricultural stages.<br>
            In addition to improving crop yields and reducing waste, IoT technology can also help farmers respond more quickly to problems that arise in their operations. For example, sensors can detect signs of disease or pest infestations early on, allowing farmers to take action before the problem becomes too severe. Similarly, real-time data on weather conditions can help farmers anticipate and mitigate the impact of extreme weather events, such as droughts or floods.
